            <p>My life shall touch a dozen lives before this day is done  drudge-filled chore or a challenging dare,

                A day to spend or a life to life.

                Shall fair or foul its imprint prove, on those my life shall hail?
                Shall blessing my impress be, or shall a blight prevail...</p>
